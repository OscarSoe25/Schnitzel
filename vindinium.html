    <h1 id="bot">My Vindinium Bot</h1>
    <p id="overview">Vindinium is a game made where we make bots to battle other bots to fight for the free the land of vindinium.
    There are mines the bots collects to gain coins and the bot with the most coins will win the battle.
    The bots can also kill other bots and when a bot kills another bot, it can take the mine of the bot that it killed
    for itself. So you can be passive and collect free mines or be agressivge and attack other bots to gain their mines. But whenever you
    collect mines or kill people or just stand still you lose health, so there are taverns where the bots can go to gain back the health. I learned that AIs still needs a line of code to function but other than that it can do the function it was told in anyway they want. My bot did do what I wanted it to do and yes, it was a little complicated setting up the code for detecting the amount of mine a certain bot has but it was worth it in the end because it worked perfectly.</p>

    <div id="code">
        <h2 id="explain">The Code</h2>
        <p> The first code added to is where the bots are going to battle. The bots can battle other people's bots 
        or go against computer generated bots.</p>
        
        <center><img src="pictures/arena.png" width:"90%";></img></center>
        
        <p>The next code is to find the positions of the enemy bots and to find your own bots positions</p>
        <center><img src="pictures/positionofbots.png" width:"90%";></img></center>
        
        <p> This next code is the task that the bot is suppose to take. The task is based on different conditions that the bot might face. Such as going to a tavern. Create an if statement then write the condition of when the bot goes to a tavern. So if the bot has less than 50 health go to a tavern, using the condition "bot.yourBot.life <= 50" and then have the task "go to tavern".</p>
        <center><img src="pictures/task.png" width:"90%";></img></center>
        <p> But you can just set a task and except the bot to do it. You need to write the code for how the bot will do that task. That means more if/else statements with more conditionals. The if statements tells the how to do and in what way and also when. You can set up the conditional anyway you want. You go to a tavern when your health is at 50 or if there is another bot nearby. You can do it however you want. These are all my "if statements" for how to do a task. </p>
        <center><img src="pictures/statements.png" width:"90%";></img></center>
        <p> For my bot I affed a special code that has my bot attack an enemy bot who has the most mines. Since I am still working on it, it not working quite the way I want it to. So it works but it's not fully finished. The code is design to target a bot with the most mines and with the help of Sam the TA, we got it somewhat work. The first one is to identify the bot with the most mines. The second one is who the task works and it tells the bot how to do it. </p>
